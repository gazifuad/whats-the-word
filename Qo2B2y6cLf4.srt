WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So
today, we really kind of talk

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,800
more about the system, the
kind of third direct innovation

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,790
factor, and then about
these indirect factors that

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,093
are important and significant,
but not as powerful, I'd argue,

12
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:37,010
as the direct factors.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,150
But first, let me just
recap last week just really

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,858
in a few seconds,
and then give us

15
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:49,400
a glimpse of what
we're getting into.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:57,830
So last week, Robert Solow,
the great growth economist,

17
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,810
developed-- really
created growth economics--

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,890
developed the theory that
the dominant causative

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,870
factor in economic
growth was, quote,

20
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,980
technological and
related innovation,

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,742
a phrase that you'll
hear all the time here.

22
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:17,660
And then we followed up
that discussion with talk

23
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,510
about Paul Romer and his
work on human capital

24
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,450
engaged in research as a kind
of second key direct innovation

25
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,740
factor.

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,170
That's the talent base that has
to be behind the R&D system.

27
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:39,440
We read Dale Jorgenson who
told us that, yes, in fact,

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,400
this innovation based
economic growth model

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,690
is in fact correct.

30
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,400
That's what happened
in the IT wave

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,625
and he showed us, in
effect, how that occurred.

32
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,550
The model was you do an
invention or a core group

33
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,910
of inventions, they
begin to scale up,

34
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,960
applications pile on them,
they enter into the economy

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,720
and really begin to
scale up in the economy.

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,110
And eventually, over time,
become a true innovation wave.

37
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,720
And we'll talk more today, as
you know, about innovation wave

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,130
theory.

39
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:20,650
We also read a piece by
some Merrill Lynch analysts,

40
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,670
and the fundamental
point in that piece

41
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,370
was that industry is very
interested in innovation,

42
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,960
but they're only prepared to
fund the very short late stage

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,160
of it.

44
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,360
So somehow, even though
the evolution to innovation

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,310
is a very long-term process,
the financial sector

46
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,740
is only going to
dive in as close

47
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,970
as they can to certainty--
in other words,

48
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,910
at a very late stage.

49
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,480
So those were kind of
our four core readings.

50
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,590
And one other idea in
that Merrill Lynch piece

51
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,890
was this notion that
innovation needs

52
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,590
to move through a series of
stages to kind of get there.

53
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,740
There needs to be
an early vision--

54
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,130
kind of a visionary who will
set out what could happen.

55
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,220
And then enabling
technologies evolve

56
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,880
that become technical
enablers for the evolution

57
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,040
to an innovation wave.

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,745
And then there's going to be
substantial talent on task.

59
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:22,870
In other words, people have
got to be-- researchers

60
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,770
have got to be working on this
in significant depth in order

61
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,180
for this thing to evolve.

62
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,990
So it's going to take a
community scale kind of effort.

63
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,390
So the first class
left us with two

64
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,660
direct or explicit
innovation factors.

65
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,930
And we could in a--

66
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,790
oversimplify them and
put them in shorthand,

67
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,410
but we could say
you've got to do R&D

68
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,190
and you've got to have a talent
base staffing that R&D system.

69
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,200
And we worked on a definition
of innovation as a system

70
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,240
for introducing
technical advance,

71
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,740
and we talked briefly about
innovation waves, which

72
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,050
we'll spend more time on today.

73
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,590
So that's a quick recap
of last week's discussion.

74
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,670
And Chris, you and
I can follow up

75
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,820
so you catch up on some of
the issues that came up there.

76
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,042
And I've posted the slides
to the STELLAR site which

77
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,459
will help as well, but I'd be
happy to talk to you further

78
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,146
about it.

79
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,610
So let me just do
a quick snapshot

80
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,470
to open up today's discussion.

81
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,300
So that's Thomas Edison.

82
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:44,010
That's his idea factory
and that's the group

83
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,550
that does the light bulb.

84
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,550
It's the light bulb
and you can see

85
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,730
the idea factory-- this building
in that scheme at the top.

86
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,500
And then you can
see the farmhouse

87
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,177
back behind which
is where Edison

88
00:04:58,177 --> 00:05:00,760
lived with his wife except that
he never spent any time there.

89
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,810
He was in the idea
factory pretty much 24/7.

90
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,820
I just want to give
you a feel for what

91
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,250
innovation is like when
it starts to take off.

92
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,510
And this is a good--

93
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,000
Edison is a classic example.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,380
So he-- very limited education.

95
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,750
He was homeschooled
by his mother.

96
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,870
He's probably pretty dyslexic.

97
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,250
We don't quite know that,
but it's probably the case.

98
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,050
As a kid, he understands
the early evolution

99
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,070
of the telegraph and he develops
kind of a newspaper sales

100
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,980
scheme during the
Civil War where

101
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,600
he gets the newspapers
ahead of time in Cleveland,

102
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
gets them out to the trains
coming into Cleveland,

103
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,850
and then sells
them on the trains.

104
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,912
And he's kind of kept--

105
00:05:50,912 --> 00:05:52,870
in other words, he kind
of beats the news cycle

106
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,470
and then unloads newspapers on
these early commuting efforts

107
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,500
as people are coming
into the city.

108
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,400
He gets his big
break by scooping up

109
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,250
the child of the
telegraph operator.

110
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,890
So trains had to operate
by telegraph systems--

111
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,190
they were a crucial technology
to enable trains to work.

112
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,700
And the telegraph operator for a
train system is very important,

113
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,790
but also obviously serves a
larger community communications

114
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,810
purpose.

115
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,270
So the kid of the
telegraph operator

116
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,860
is down on the tracks--

117
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,080
train is coming down the tracks.

118
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,190
Edison, as a boy,
sees what's happening,

119
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,155
rushes, scoops the child up,
barely escapes the train.

120
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:36,780
Needless to say, the
telegraph operator

121
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,610
is appreciative, so he
trains Edison in Morse code

122
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,130
and how telegraph
operations work.

123
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,980
So he becomes an expert on
telegraph, which is obviously

124
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,130
early electrical technology.

125
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,190
And he becomes a master
at it, and then he

126
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,080
becomes very interested
in technology itself.

127
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,180
So over time, he
goes to New York--

128
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,370
he develops what
becomes, in effect,

129
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,530
an early stock
ticker, which can--

130
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,060
what we would call multiplex.

131
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,330
In other words, you could
receive multiple telegraphing

132
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,050
signals and communications
over the same line, which

133
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,500
obviously was a key enabler
for keeping track of stocks.

134
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,390
So he becomes very close to
the scions of Wall Street,

135
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,590
including JP Morgan.

136
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,730
He gets to know them all
because he's like their enabler.

137
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,300
And then he sees this thing
in Ansonia Connecticut.

138
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,840
It's not-- it's a much
bigger version of this,

139
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,780
but there's this
kind of gimmick--

140
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:41,190
these nine foot tall
polls with a spark,

141
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,260
because they're
positive and negative

142
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,910
a spark travels across--

143
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,743
looks really cool.

144
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:48,160
People are wondering
around-- they

145
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,910
don't know what to do
with it, but they're

146
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,630
awestruck by this kind of
electric movement of lightning

147
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,520
going across the two poles.

148
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,110
Edison has the idea-- oh, light.

149
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,020
So he takes the-- he makes
his money on Wall Street,

150
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,750
he takes all his money out.

151
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,320
He goes off into a farm
in Menlo Park, New Jersey

152
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,510
out into this rural area.

153
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,790
He hires this team which
consists of an interesting mix

154
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,080
of artisans--

155
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,910
like, there's an incredibly
important glass blower here,

156
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,490
which heralds back to the
MIT glass lab which I always

157
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,930
buy stuff from.

158
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,620
And there's also
scientists and engineers

159
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,750
in here, but a lot
of people who just

160
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,270
know how to do things
who are very good at sort

161
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,850
of mechanical tinkering.

162
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,580
And it's an interesting
team, and he

163
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,190
has to take this idea
of this weird arc

164
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,650
that he saw-- these nine
foot tall couple of poles

165
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,680
that he saw in
Ansonia Connecticut

166
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,930
and turn it into a light bulb.

167
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:56,273
It's not an easy job
and it's very intense.

168
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:57,940
There's only a certain
amount of money--

169
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,380
the money is going to run out.

170
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,550
He's gotta get this thing done
before he runs out of cash.

171
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,610
And they work
literally all the time.

172
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,380
They're always on it but they're
having the time of their lives.

173
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,110
So there's a wood
stove in here over in--

174
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,140
I'm not sure-- maybe
it's in another corner.

175
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,490
But around midnight, they all
gather around the wood stove

176
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,290
and they're--

177
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,860
rap music has not
been invented yet,

178
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:33,360
so they do doggerel verses which
they throw at one another--

179
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,450
insulting and funny and
this incredible doggerel

180
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,700
verse back and forth going on.

181
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,360
And they all have big cherry
pies and apple pies at midnight

182
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,390
and gather around the stove.

183
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,670
It's a very intense effort.

184
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,880
And actually, Edison
is away for so long

185
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,127
from the farmhouse which is
further back on the property

186
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,460
that at one point, when he
comes in at like 2:00 o'clock

187
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,440
in the morning, his wife
pulls a revolver on him

188
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,065
thinking he's an
intruder because she's

189
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:01,850
seen him so rarely.

190
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,080
Fortunately, she doesn't shoot.

191
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,840
But there they are gathered
on the idea factory,

192
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:12,330
and eventually they come
up with the core concepts.

193
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,550
The vacuum tube
obviously is core here

194
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,380
and the right
filament is core here.

195
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,860
They come up with a working
model of the electric light.

196
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,420
There's only one problem--

197
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,910
there's no electrical system.

198
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,717
There's no nothing.

199
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:27,300
So they've got a
wonderful application

200
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,220
for a nonexistent system.
